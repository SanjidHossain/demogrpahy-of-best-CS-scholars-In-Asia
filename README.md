# demogrpahy-of-best-CS-scholars-In-Asia
## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to gather information of best 1000 Computer Science researchers from [this website](https://research.com/scientists-rankings/computer-science). <br/> 
Later we utilized the scraped data to understand the following demographics and correlations using Tableau Dashboard: 

1. A barchart of Countries with highest number of scientists that are under 1000 in the wolrd.
2. Correraltion of naitonal Rank and other factors
3. Asian University with good research background
4. Map view of Latin and Asian countries with number of scholars in them.

## Findings and Observations from the [Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sanjid.hossain/viz/CapstoneProject1diffrenvariations/Dashboard1?publish=yes)
1. USA has moost of the top CS scientists in the world. alsmot of the top 1000 are in united states.
2. National rank has direct correlation to H-Index. 
3. In southern Asia and Oceania Singapore has the best research background.
4. Between Latin and Asian countries, Asian Countries has more top CS scientists.
